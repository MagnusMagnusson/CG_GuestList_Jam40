text = @"Hello! 

Thank you for playing my game.

Before we begin: This game relies a lot on color identification, pattern matching, reading comprehension, and clicking moving targets.

If any of that may pose a problem to you (for instance on account of color blindness or dyslexia) I've provided you with a handy set of accessibility options so that you can hopefully customize your game experience and have a more enjoyable time as a result.

You can find the accessibility screen under 'Options > Accessibility'.

Have fun!
Mr. Magnus."
