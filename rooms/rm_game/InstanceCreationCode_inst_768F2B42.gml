With kind regards to the members of the crimson guild discord, who kept me sane and offered untold assistance during the jam.

With deepest gratitude to my loving partner, who showed me inhumane patience and understanding as I locked myself in our office for four days straight. 


All other assets (I am pretty sure) were created during the jam by Mr. Magnus, including the damned python highscore API because I hate myself and needed more work.


Thank you for playing my game!";
